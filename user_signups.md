Perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs break down everything for **user signup, authentication, subscriptions, account management, and deletion**, including all Stripe payment/subscription integration. This will be **platform-agnostic**, but tailored for a modern SaaS using Supabase Auth (email/password, OAuth), and Stripe for payments.

# üìù User Signup & Subscription System Launch Checklist

*Use this as a master implementation guide. Subtasks can be split into individual Markdown files if you want more detail for devs/contractors/team.*

---

## 1. User Signup & Authentication

* [ ] **Set up Supabase Auth:**

  * [ ] Enable email/password signup/login
  * [ ] Enable OAuth providers (Google, Apple, GitHub as needed)
  * [ ] Configure email verification for new users
  * [ ] Set up email templates/branding for sign up, reset, verification

* [ ] **Frontend:**

  * [ ] Build signup and login forms (React Native, React, etc.)
  * [ ] Handle errors, loading, and validation (strong passwords, unique email)
  * [ ] Show email verification required prompt if user not verified
  * [ ] Implement forgot password/reset password flow

* [ ] **Backend:**

  * [ ] Protect all sensitive endpoints with auth (JWT/token-based, via Supabase)
  * [ ] Sanitize all incoming user data

---

## 2. Stripe Integration: Payments & Subscriptions

* [ ] **Stripe Setup:**

  * [ ] Create Stripe account, add business info, set up payouts
  * [ ] Define Products & Pricing (one or more plans, monthly/yearly, etc.)
  * [ ] Enable test mode for development

* [ ] **Stripe API Integration:**

  * [ ] Use Stripe Checkout or Stripe Elements to create secure payment UI
  * [ ] Link Supabase user to Stripe customer (`user_id` <-> `customer_id`)
  * [ ] On successful payment, store subscription info in your DB (`user_subscriptions` table, etc.)
  * [ ] Webhook: Listen for Stripe events (subscription created, canceled, failed, payment received, etc.)
  * [ ] Sync subscription status to your DB on relevant webhook events

* [ ] **Frontend:**

  * [ ] Add ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù or ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù button in app UI
  * [ ] Show user their current plan, renewal date, invoice history
  * [ ] Handle billing update/cancel/change/coupon flows
  * [ ] Restrict premium features to active subscribers

* [ ] **Backend:**

  * [ ] Implement middleware/check on each protected endpoint (only allow if active subscriber)
  * [ ] Store user‚Äôs Stripe customer ID and subscription status
  * [ ] Clean up and handle Stripe webhook errors/failures

---

## 3. Account Management & Self-Service

* [ ] **User Profile:**

  * [ ] Allow users to update email, password (and optionally: name, profile image, etc.)
  * [ ] Enforce re-authentication for sensitive changes

* [ ] **Subscription Management:**

  * [ ] Users can view/manage/cancel subscription from dashboard
  * [ ] Display next billing date, plan info, payment history

* [ ] **Account Deletion (GDPR/Privacy-Ready):**

  * [ ] Simple, accessible ‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù button in user settings
  * [ ] Confirm intent (modal/dialog + email, if desired)
  * [ ] On delete:

    * [ ] Remove user from Supabase Auth
    * [ ] Remove personal data from DB (or pseudonymize if legal/accounting required)
    * [ ] Cancel Stripe subscription (via API)
    * [ ] Send account deletion confirmation email
  * [ ] Comply with local laws (store minimal data if required, but don‚Äôt retain more than needed)

---

## 4. Edge Cases & Best Practices

* [ ] **Billing Edge Cases:**

  * [ ] Handle failed payments, retries, and grace periods
  * [ ] Downgrade/cancel premium access on subscription cancellation (with optional grace period)
  * [ ] Invoice download/receipts for users
  * [ ] Refund requests and chargebacks (Stripe Dashboard/manual process)

* [ ] **Security & Abuse Prevention:**

  * [ ] Enforce strong password and rate-limiting on signup/login
  * [ ] Prevent multiple free trials per user/email/payment method (if desired)
  * [ ] Require email verification before using premium features

* [ ] **Compliance:**

  * [ ] Update Privacy Policy and TOS to reflect billing and data practices
  * [ ] Provide users a way to export their data (optional but recommended)

---

## 5. Technical Table Structures (Supabase/Postgres)

**Example table for tracking subscriptions:**

```sql
create table user_subscriptions (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  stripe_customer_id text not null,
  stripe_subscription_id text not null,
  status text not null, -- active, canceled, past_due, trialing, etc.
  plan text,
  period_end timestamp,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

---

## 6. Example Webhook Handler (Python/FastAPI)

**File: `backend_api_routes/stripe_webhooks.py`**

```python
@router.post("/stripe/webhook")
async def stripe_webhook(request: Request):
    payload = await request.body()
    sig_header = request.headers.get("stripe-signature")
    event = None
    try:
        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(payload, sig_header, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(400, "Invalid payload")
    except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError as e:
        raise HTTPException(400, "Invalid signature")

    if event['type'] == 'customer.subscription.updated':
        sub = event['data']['object']
        # Update user_subscriptions in Supabase based on sub['customer'] and sub['status']
    elif event['type'] == 'customer.subscription.deleted':
        # Mark user as canceled in DB
        ...
    # Handle other event types as needed

    return {"status": "success"}
```

---

## 7. Example: Enforcing Premium Access on API Endpoints

**File: `backend_api_routes/any_protected_route.py`**

```python
def require_premium_user(user_id: str):
    sub = supabase.table('user_subscriptions').select('status').eq('user_id', user_id).single().execute()
    if sub.data is None or sub.data['status'] not in ["active", "trialing"]:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Subscription required.")

@router.get("/premium-feature")
async def premium_feature(user=Depends(require_authenticated_user)):
    require_premium_user(user['id'])
    # ...rest of the logic
```

---

## 8. Example: Account Deletion Flow

**File: `backend_api_routes/account.py`**

```python
@router.post("/account/delete")
async def delete_account(user=Depends(require_authenticated_user)):
    user_id = user['id']
    # 1. Delete from Supabase Auth (call Supabase Admin API)
    # 2. Delete/pseudonymize personal data in your tables
    # 3. Cancel any Stripe subscription via API
    # 4. Return confirmation
    ...
```

---

# ‚úÖ Next Steps

* [ ] Review this checklist and adapt to your product‚Äôs needs
* [ ] Break down each main item into sub-markdown files as needed (I can generate those for you!)
* [ ] Prioritize core flows (signup, payment, subscription status enforcement, account deletion)
* [ ] Implement table schemas and webhook endpoints
* [ ] Test full end-to-end flows with test Stripe accounts and multiple users

---

**Want to start with a specific flow, like Stripe subscriptions, or the actual code for user deletion/Stripe sync?
Just say which part and I‚Äôll write the detailed Markdown + code for that area next!**
