## Test Coverage Strategy

### Unit Test Requirements (80% minimum coverage)
1. **Backend**: All service methods, validators, calculations
2. **Frontend**: Components, hooks, utilities
3. **API**: All endpoints, middleware, validators
4. **Database**: Functions, triggers, constraints

### Integration Test Scenarios
1. **Authentication Flow**: Login → Dashboard → Transaction → Logout
2. **Data Flow**: Create transaction → Update portfolio → View analytics
3. **Currency Flow**: Multi-currency transaction → Conversion → Display
4. **Cache Flow**: Miss → Populate → Hit → Invalidate → Refresh

### E2E Test Automation
```yaml
Critical User Journeys:
  - New user onboarding
  - Add/Edit/Delete transactions
  - View portfolio performance
  - Generate analytics reports
  - Multi-currency operations
  - Mobile/Web sync scenarios
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- Dashboard load: < 2 seconds (100 holdings)
- API response: < 500ms (p95)
- Database queries: < 100ms (p95)
- Cache hit rate: > 80%
- Memory usage: < 500MB per user session

## Simplified Data Flow Architecture

### Current Flow (Inefficient)
```
Frontend → Backend → Supabase → Backend → AlphaVantage → Backend → Supabase → Backend → Frontend
(11 hops, multiple round trips)
```

### Optimized Flow
```
Frontend → Backend → [Cache|Supabase + Background AlphaVantage] → Backend → Frontend
(5 hops, single round trip)
```

### Implementation Details
1. **Request Consolidation**: Single dashboard endpoint
2. **Smart Caching**: Multi-tier cache (Memory → Redis → Database)
3. **Background Updates**: Async price updates with WebSocket notifications
4. **Batch Operations**: Group related queries
5. **Data Streaming**: Server-sent events for real-time updates

---

## File Consolidation Plan

### Duplicate Code Removal
1. **Frontend Components**
   - Merge: `AnalyticsDividendsTab.tsx` + `AnalyticsDividendsTabRefactored.tsx`
   - Consolidate: Chart components into shared library
   - Remove: Unused API endpoint implementations

2. **Backend Services**
   - Merge: Duplicate dividend route handlers
   - Consolidate: Price fetching logic
   - Unify: Cache management code

3. **Shared Code**
   - Create: `shared/types` for cross-platform types
   - Move: Common utilities to shared library
   - Standardize: API client implementations

### Estimated Code Reduction: 35-40%
