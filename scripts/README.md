- **Historical Trending**: Maintains quality metrics history with trend analysis

### üìä Real-Time Dashboard
- **Auto-refreshing HTML dashboard** (updates every 5 minutes)
- **Visual quality indicators** with red/green status
- **Threshold monitoring** with immediate violation alerts
- **Historical data visualization** and trend analysis

### üö® Automated Alerting
- **Real-time alerts** when quality metrics fall below thresholds
- **CI/CD integration** with quality gate enforcement
- **Configurable alert thresholds** for different quality metrics
- **Alert history** with detailed violation reports

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend monitoring)
- npm/yarn package manager

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Install monitoring system
npm run quality:install

# Or manual installation
pip install mypy
npm install -g jscpd type-coverage

# Run first quality scan
npm run quality:check
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Single Quality Scan
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality check
npm run quality:check

# Or directly with Python
python scripts/quality_monitor_safe.py
```

#### Continuous Monitoring (Daemon Mode)
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring (5-minute intervals)
npm run quality:watch

# Custom interval
python scripts/quality_monitor_safe.py --daemon --interval 10
```

#### Dashboard Only
```bash
# Generate dashboard without running scans
npm run quality:dashboard
```

#### CI/CD Quality Gate
```bash
# Run quality gate for CI/CD (exits with error code on failure)
npm run quality:ci

# Strict mode (warnings treated as failures)
python scripts/ci_quality_gate.py --strict
```

### Dashboard Access

The quality dashboard is generated as `quality_dashboard.html` in the project root. Open in any web browser for real-time quality monitoring.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Visual status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Real-time metric values vs. thresholds
- Historical trend data
- Detailed issue breakdown

## Quality Thresholds

### Zero Tolerance Standards
- **TypeScript Coverage**: ‚â•98% (ZERO `any` types allowed)
- **Python Type Errors**: 0 errors (strict mypy compliance)
- **Security Violations**: 0 violations (no raw SQL, proper CORS, Decimal for financial calculations)

### Performance Standards
- **Code Duplication**: ‚â§3% maximum
- **Bundle Size**: ‚â§500KB target
- **Load Time**: ‚â§2000ms target

## Monitoring Details

### TypeScript Monitoring
- Scans all `.ts` and `.tsx` files for `any` type usage
- Runs `tsc --noEmit --strict` for compilation validation
- Tracks type coverage percentage
- Reports specific files with violations

### Python Monitoring  
- Detects missing type hints in function definitions
- Runs mypy in strict mode if available
- Checks for untyped parameters and return values
- Validates financial calculation type safety

### Security Monitoring
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Detects f-string SQL construction and string concatenation
- **Financial Precision**: Ensures Decimal usage for monetary calculations
- **CORS Security**: Identifies unsafe `allow_origins=["*"]` configurations
- **Input Validation**: Checks for proper type validation at API boundaries

### Performance Monitoring
- Analyzes JavaScript bundle sizes in build output
- Estimates load times based on bundle size
- Monitors for performance regression
- Tracks bundle analysis over time

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The system includes automated GitHub Actions workflow generation:

```bash
# Generate CI/CD configuration files
python scripts/ci_quality_gate.py --generate-config
```

This creates:
- `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Pre-commit quality gate
- `scripts/docker_healthcheck.sh` - Docker health check

### Quality Gate Enforcement

The CI/CD quality gate:
- **Blocks deployments** that violate quality standards
- **Generates JUnit reports** for CI integration
- **Creates artifacts** with detailed quality reports
- **Supports strict mode** (warnings treated as failures)

### Pre-commit Hooks

Automatic pre-commit hook installation prevents commits that violate quality standards:

```bash
# Installed automatically with generate-config
git commit -m "Your commit"  # Will run quality check first
```

## Configuration

### Threshold Customization

Edit thresholds in `quality_monitor_safe.py`:

```python
self.thresholds = {
    'typescript_coverage': 98.0,  # Minimum TypeScript coverage
    'python_type_errors': 0,      # Zero tolerance for type errors
    'security_violations': 0,      # Zero tolerance for security issues
    'code_duplication': 3.0,      # Maximum code duplication percentage
    'bundle_size_kb': 500,        # Maximum bundle size in KB
    'load_time_ms': 2000,         # Maximum load time in milliseconds
}
```

### Alert Configuration

Alerts are automatically generated when thresholds are violated. Alert files are saved in `metrics/alerts/` with timestamps.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### TypeScript Compiler Not Found
```bash
# Install TypeScript in frontend directory
cd frontend && npm install typescript
```

#### MyPy Not Available
```bash
# Install mypy for Python type checking
pip install mypy
```

#### jscpd Not Found
```bash
# Install jscpd globally for code duplication detection
npm install -g jscpd
```

#### Permission Denied (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.py
```

### Debug Mode

Run with verbose output for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Enable detailed logging
python scripts/quality_monitor_safe.py --project-root . 2>&1 | tee quality_scan.log
```

## Monitoring Results

### Current Project Status (Example)

Based on the latest scan of the Portfolio Tracker codebase:

- **Status**: ‚ùå FAIL (Multiple violations detected)
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 0.0% (1,463 `any` types found)
- **Python Type Errors**: 118 errors detected
- **Security Violations**: 173 violations found
- **Code Duplication**: ‚úÖ 1.5% (within acceptable range)

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Type Safety Crisis**: Eliminate all `any` types in TypeScript files
2. **Python Type Annotations**: Add missing type hints to all functions
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Fix SQL injection risks and CORS configuration
4. **Financial Calculations**: Convert float/int usage to Decimal types

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. Run `npm run quality:check` before committing changes
2. Monitor dashboard for continuous quality feedback
3. Address violations immediately when detected

### Continuous Integration
1. Quality gate runs automatically on all pull requests
2. Deployments blocked if quality standards not met
3. Quality reports archived as CI artifacts

### Production Monitoring
1. Daemon mode provides continuous monitoring
2. Real-time alerts for quality degradation
3. Historical trending for quality improvement tracking

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
- **Never commit** code that violates quality standards
- **Fix violations immediately** when detected
- **Use feature flags** for risky changes
- **Monitor dashboard regularly** for early violation detection

### Team Workflow
- **Quality-first mindset**: Quality violations block all development
- **Collaborative fixing**: Team works together to maintain standards
- **Continuous improvement**: Regular review of quality metrics and thresholds

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- Review quality thresholds monthly
- Update monitoring tools as needed
- Archive old metric history files
- Monitor dashboard performance

### Extending the System
- Add new quality metrics to `QualityMonitor` class
- Customize alert thresholds for specific project needs
- Integrate with external monitoring systems
- Add team-specific reporting features
